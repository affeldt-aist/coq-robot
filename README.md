This repository contains an experimental library for the mathematics
of rigid body transformations using the Coq proof-assistant and the
Mathematical Components library.

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Formal Foundations for Modeling Robot Manipulators
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-robot
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/affeldt-aist/robot.git
cd robot
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```

## Disclaimer

This library is still at an experimental stage.  Contents may change
and definitions and theorems may be renamed.  Use at your own risk.

## Documentation

This library can be used to address the forward kinematics problem
of robot manipulators.  It contains theories for angles,
three-dimensional geometry (including three-dimensional rotations,
skew-symmetric matrices, quaternions), rigid body transformations
(isometries, homogeneous representation, Denavit-Hartenberg
convention, screw motions), and an application to the SCARA robot
manipulator.

Each file is documented more precisely in its header.
