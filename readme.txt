This is an archive of the proof scripts discussed in the paper "Formal
Foundations for Modeling Robot Manipulators" by Reynald Affeldt and
Cyril Cohen (CPP 2017).

NB: All the proofs discussed in the paper have been completed.  The
archive contains a few proofs in "Abort state": this is work in
progress and is not discussed in the paper.

boolp.v, reals.v come from
https://github.com/strub/coq-alternate-reals
by P.-Y. Strub

Software version: the proof scripts require the following software to
compile:
- Coq 8.7
- a recent version (late August 2016) of the Mathematical Component
  library
